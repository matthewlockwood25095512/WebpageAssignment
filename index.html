        <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p class = "large" id = "introFont"> My background related to taking this course and my future direction in this industry began when I joined the Army at 18 within the Royal Signals, I specialised in satellite communications. This was obviously a technical role although working on very different systems.
    </p>
    <p  class = "large" id = "introFont"> After leaving the Army I worked for several telecoms companies installing PBX and cloud based phone systems and basic networking. Again this was a technical role that I thoroughly enjoyed and took pride in engineering projects and having a completed solution at the end of it.
    </p>
    <p class = "large" id = "introFont"> I believe that this change in direction concentrating on the development of applications and software coding will be a natural progression and that my existing skills will be transferable once I am familiar with the new platforms and languages.
    </p>
    <p class = "large" id = "introFont"> So far on the course I have enjoyed learning the Javascript and working in a team environment. The whole feel and atmosphere of this industry is welcoming and relaxed.

            <h2>Unit 1: Improving
                    Productivity with IT </h1>
            <br>
            <h2>Describing the purpose of IT in modern business</h2>
            <p class = "large"> 
                The use of IT within businesses has improved productivity and simplified processes. For example, keeping records on paper would have taken a lot of time and space to store the information. It would be time consuming to search those records.
                With digital applications, the storage would be condensed within a smaller space and records can be quickly searched.
            </p>
            <p class = "large"> 
                “Resource management plays a crucial role in business success. When it comes to medium or large organisation, it is very hard for the top management to manage all the resources manually. Information technology has played a vital role in automating such complex problems by introducing user friendly solutions.”
            </p>
            <p class = "large"> 
                Digital applications can be programmed to undertake complex tasks instantly and repetitively at any time whereas historically those tasks would have limitations.
            </p class = "large"> 
            <h2>1.2 - Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully</h2>
            <br>
            <p class = "large"> 
                Other methods and skills are required to successfully complete any digital projects
                “Skills such as time management, resource management, planning, organizing, and delegating can be developed in almost any role.”
