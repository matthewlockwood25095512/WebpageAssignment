        <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p class = "large" id = "introFont"> My background related to taking this course and my future direction in this industry began when I joined the Army at 18 within the Royal Signals, I specialised in satellite communications. This was obviously a technical role although working on very different systems.
    </p>
    <p  class = "large" id = "introFont"> After leaving the Army I worked for several telecoms companies installing PBX and cloud based phone systems and basic networking. Again this was a technical role that I thoroughly enjoyed and took pride in engineering projects and having a completed solution at the end of it.
    </p>
    <p class = "large" id = "introFont"> I believe that this change in direction concentrating on the development of applications and software coding will be a natural progression and that my existing skills will be transferable once I am familiar with the new platforms and languages.
    </p>
    <p class = "large" id = "introFont"> So far on the course I have enjoyed learning the Javascript and working in a team environment. The whole feel and atmosphere of this industry is welcoming and relaxed.
