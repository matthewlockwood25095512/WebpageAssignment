<h2>3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency – could you have been more efficient when making your website? How? Could you have done it in teams? </h2>
<p class = "large introFont textback">When using Trello to organise the project, this only had benefits that helped organisation. Visualising my thoughts and plans and being able to arrange them into “to do”, “Doing” and “Done” improved productivity as I had somewhere to go to tell me what to do next.
        Github was even more useful as I could push my work to the cloud and retrieve it at home to do more work and then again during the day at work.
        
        Working in a team would have been very beneficial as the research could be divided and more extensively studied. The work could also have been divided evenly and shared using Github.

        <h2>3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency </h2>
        <p class = "large introFont textback">
                A good way of improving productivity is using an Agile working method.
                These builds are provided in iterations. Each iteration typically lasts from about one to three weeks. Every iteration involves cross functional teams working simultaneously on various areas like

            </ul>
        </p>
<p class = "large introFont textback">With the Agile method comes advantages such as tracking how long tasks last, the ability to take regular breaks, and self-imposed deadlines</p>
<h2>3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects – what would you do differently next time? Team work? Use of Slack?</h2>
<p class = "large introFont textback">If I would do things differently I would make specific slots for certain parts of the project and set mini deadlines for each. Teamwork would definitely help as it would split the workload and you can focus on one particular area. I found that I was swapping between research and the building of my website although this was a nice natural break from spending too long on one area.
    </p>
    <h2>3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions        </h2>
<p class = "large introFont textback">The first way I would test any digital solution is by doing my own tests, making sure the website looks good and you can navigate through the pages by selecting the nav bar buttons and links to other sites. I only make small changes and apply them as soon as possible so if there are any mistakes I can rectify them quickly.
        I would also ask other people to test my website so I can get their opinions.
