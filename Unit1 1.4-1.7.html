            <h2>1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects – what causes digital projects to fail? Why?</h2>
            <br>
            Despite the best intentions and ever-evolving methodologies, at the end of the day many digital/IT projects still are not successful.  Several different studies over the past five years put the industry success rate below 60%.

Dr. Dobbs did a survey on digital project execution a few years ago and found:
- Traditional projects: 47% are successful, 36% are challenged, and 17% are failures
- Ad-hoc projects: 49% are successful, 37% are challenged, and 14% are failures
- Agile projects: 60% are successful, 28% are challenged, and 12% are failures.

Deadline, specifically less than a year
Poorly defined outcome, A company may have a requirement but not know the details of how to get there or the end result. They may be solving the wrong problem.
Lack of accountability and communication, When a project is left to the “IT guys” there may be a disconnect between management that want a solution and the people carrying out the work.
Lack of real world testing, A customer may have an idea for an application and approach a company to develop but hasn’t thought through testing and if it’s actually a good idea or more importantly a profitable project.


“Fixed plans that don’t account for change: The notion of a “5-year-plan” is dead. Using Agile, iterative processes that allow for frequent tweaks and improvement is the only way to ensure that success is lasting. Your digital project plans should be flexible enough to reflect business changes within the company and the market at any given moment.”

<h2>1.5 Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software – how do you select the right kind of technology for the job?
    </h2>
    <br>
    Different technologies need to be considered for different projects. If a project is started and an issue arises that causes a blocker then don't be afraid to cut the tech loose and start again.
Also if you are a non-technical founder, it’s tempting to find the nearest developer and rely on their advice when choosing a tech stack. However, developers may be biased towards the technology tools with which they are most comfortable, or judge technologies purely on technical merits rather than business needs


Things for a developer to consider,
Analyse project needs
Choose technology that can be used throughout the duration of the project and will grow with kit.
Have a backup plan.
Ensure staff are fully trained on the chosen technologies.
<br>
<h2>1.6 Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes. – How has trello helped you plan and how can git and GitHub help with your codes version control</h2>
<br>
GitHub has been very useful as I can access the same project from different locations with the work Macbook and a home Windows PC.

Trello has assisted in visualising my thoughts and plans and organising them into lists of “To Do,” “Doing” and “Done”

The use of VS code is quite simple as it supports hundreds of languages and is instantly productive with syntax highlighting, bracket-matching, auto-indentation and box-selection, snippets.

In the case of this project I used HTML, Javascript and CSS all on VS Code.

<h2>1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects – How does GDPR impact digital projects?</h2>
<br>
GDPR gives data subjects, such as users of online services, a greater degree of control over the processing of their data

For example, if you’d like to know what Spotify knows about you, you can ask them for a copy of all the data they store about you or even ask the company to wipe the entire dataset: your name, email, listening history, and so on.
This has resulted in the increase of data collection consent forms. With this in mind Software designers and developers will have to know at least the basic GDPR rules to be able to create apps that can address the clients’ needs and also complies with the GDPR

Developers will need to know about the rule of “data protection by design and by default,” referring to the implementation of appropriate technical and organizational measures for ensuring that, by default, only personal data which is necessary for each specific purpose of the processing is processed. This applies to the amount of data collected, the extent of its processing, the period of its retention as well as its accessibility.

Companies need to minimise the amount of data store about a user and can no longer store data for future use without a valid reason which was and still continues to be a very common approach to data retention, examples of which include the widespread practice of collecting email contacts for marketing, sales purposes or even designing user account registration forms.

This needs to be considered at the start of a project and possibly employing staff members or a company that can advise on these constraints.
