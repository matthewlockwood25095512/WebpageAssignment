                Productivity with IT </h1>

        <h2>Describing the purpose of IT in modern business</h2>
        <p>
            The use of IT within businesses has improved productivity and simplified processes. For example, keeping records on paper would have taken a lot of time and space to store the information. It would be time consuming to search those records.
            With digital applications, the storage would be condensed within a smaller space and records can be quickly searched.
        </p>

            “Resource management plays a crucial role in business success. When it comes to medium or large organisation, it is very hard for the top management to manage all the resources manually. ... Information technology has played a vital role in automating such complex problems by introducing user friendly solutions.”
        </p>
        <p>
            Digital applications can be programmed to undertake complex tasks instantly and repetitively at any time whereas historically those tasks would have limitations.
        </p>
        <h2>1.2 - Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
            Other methods and skills are required to successfully complete any digital projects
            “Skills such as time management, resource management, planning, organizing, and delegating can be developed in almost any role.”
