                <h2>1.1 Describing the content and layout for each page</h2>
                <p class = "large introFont textback">I decided the layout of my pages with the nav bar in mind. Having the same bar on every page so that you can navigate to any part of the website from anywhere else in the site. I wanted a picture behind my text and text boxes but found that this obstructed the reading of the content. I wanted the width of the text box to be fairly narrow so that the text wasn’t too intimidating.
                                            I chose to have seperate pages for each section again so that it wasn’t too much.

                <h2>1.5 Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites </h2>
                <p class = "large introFont textback">Copyright, designs and patents act 1988
                    <br>

                                                    The Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988, is the current UK copyright law. It gives the creators of literary, dramatic, musical and artistic works the right to control the ways in which their material may be used. The rights cover: Broadcast and public performance, copying, adapting, issuing, renting and lending copies to the public. In many cases, the creator will also have the right to be identified as the author and to object to distortions of his work.
                                                    Copyright arises when an individual or organisation creates a work, and applies to a work if it is regarded as original, and exhibits a degree of labour, skill or judgement.
                                                    Interpretation is related to the independent creation rather than the idea behind the creation. For example, your idea for a book would not itself be protected, but the actual content of a book you write would be. In other words, someone else is still entitled to write their own book around the same idea, provided they do not directly copy or adapt yours to do so.
                                                    Names, titles, short phrases and colours are not generally considered unique or substantial enough to be covered, but a creation, such as a logo, that combines these elements may be.
                                                    Normally the individual or collective who authored the work will exclusively own the rights. However, if a work is produced as part of employment then normally the work belongs to the person/company who hired the individual. For freelance or commissioned work, rights will usually belong to the author of the work, unless there is an agreement to the contrary, (i.e. in a contract for service).
                                                    Only the owner, or his exclusive licensee can bring proceedings in the courts against an infringement.
                                                    <br>
                                                    This means that you must get permission for something that is another  person's property. When I have been using direct quotes from a website I have referenced it at the end of the website.

                <h2>1.6 Describing access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that people with disabilities may face when using web pages and how we can overcome them 
                    </h2>
                    <p class = "large introFont textback">
                            The Internet isn't always "one size fits all." Every day, inaccessible web design prevents billions of people in the disabled community from an easy online experience.
                            <br>
                            For those with visual impairments, learning difficulties, hearing loss and more, there are dozens of unique challenges waiting behind every URL. But building a disability-friendly site is a lot simpler than you might think.

                        <li class="lists">1. Use alt tags. When you hover over an image the device will say what it is outloud.</li>
                        <li class="lists">2. Create subtitles and transcripts. Used for video and people that are hard of hearing.</li>
                        <li class="lists">3. Put full stops in between abbreviations. For example instaed of HTML use H.T.M.L</li>
                        <li class="lists">4. Utilize colour control. Practicing smart color choices is useful for a website with any kind of audience. Avoid pairing garish colors, and be wary of using yellow, blue and green close to one another (this is especially difficult for colorblind users). Black text on a white background is the best general practice, because it's readable for most audiences.</li>

                    <p class = "large introFont textback">The file types that I have used on my website, firstly was a HTML file type. This was to determine what language of code I will be inputting. The next was the type of images that I used. I mainly used PNG images to avoid taking up big blocks of the page with unused space. The PNG image has a transparent background.</p>
