<h2>2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used? E.g. Visual Studio Code, Codepen, Trello</h2>
<br>
<p class = "large introFont textback">
        My opinions of the IT tools that I used for the project are all positive. Visual Studio Code had the benefit of being a “one for all” platform. I could use it to write HTML, CSS and Javascript.
        It also worked well on both the work Macbook and my Windows PC at home seamlessly.
        The ability to upload code to Github was useful as work could be completed in any location by downloading the latest upload of the project.
        The use of Trello was not extensive as I was working on my own and I believe the platform would shine in a team situation although it was useful to visualise my thoughts and tasks rather than remembering them.        
</p>
<h2>2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate E.g. Visual Studio Code, Codepen, Trello</h2>
<p class = "large introFont textback">
        Visual studio is an appropriate tool for the project as it allowed the use of all the languages that we used, Javascript, HTML and CSS.
        Microsoft said that “It is Hard to get something free on the same level as Visual Studio.”
        Trello was a good tool as it is simple and took little time to update and use.
        I would possibly try a different programme called Dreamweaver that has a feature where it can display the webpage in the same browser as you are coding. This allows you to inspect the code in realtime.
        </p>
        <h2>2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project – are you happy with your website? Why? Why not? You should review it on the website itself in the interests of openness. What would you change?</h2>
<br>
<p class = "large introFont textback">I am very happy with my website. At this stage I am not fully finished but I have had a chance to try out all the basic features of HTML and CSS. My strengths are that I have a fully working Navigation bar and relevant pictures with a link to those websites.
        I am happy with the basic layout and colour schemes with the background.
        The content is I believe factual and informative of my learning journey this week and throughout the course. The only changes I would make is spending more time exploring different colours and themes for each page to be different.
        </p>
        <h2>2.4 Describe further improvements you can make to your project</h2>
        <p class = "large introFont textback">Obviously improvements can be made and I would never be fully satisfied as improvements can always be made to the layout, sizing and look of the page. I could also research the subject a lot more as it would be hard to exhaust the available information on the subject as it is extensive
</p>
<h2>2.5 Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose </h2>
<p class = "large introFont textback">The first requirement was to plan, select and use appropriate IT systems and software. The outcome of this matches the requirement as the project ran smoothly with the chosen tools. The next requirement was to review and adapt the ongoing use of IT tools and systems to make sure that activities are successful. This was done successfully too as the tools and systems continued to work well as the project continued.
        The requirements of the website were met as we had to demonstrate we could use the HTML and CSS to change text fonts, sizes and styles, create a flexbox, create ID tags and classes and to apply them to the HTML also the correct use of headings.
