<h2 class = "large introFont textback">2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used? E.g. Visual Studio Code, Codepen, Trello</h2>

<p class = "large introFont textback">
        My opinions of the IT tools that I used for the project are all positive. Visual Studio Code had the benefit of being a “one for all” platform. I could use it to write HTML, CSS and Javascript.
        It also worked well on both the work Macbook and my Windows PC at home seamlessly.
        The ability to upload code to Github was useful as work could be completed in any location by downloading the latest upload of the project.
        The use of Trello was not extensive as I was working on my own and I believe the platform would shine in a team situation although it was useful to visualise my thoughts and tasks rather than remembering them.
